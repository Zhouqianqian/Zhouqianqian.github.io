## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">
I am currently a master student in Computer Technology in Xiamen University and I am applying Ph.D. programs in USA. I received the B.E. degree in Communication Engineering in Zhengzhou University in 2016.

I participated in the Robotics Lab in my undergraduate school and did some interesting projects. My currently research interests focus on decision and planning for autonomous vehicles, reinforcement learning (RL) and control on mobile robots. It is still challenging to make auto-cars and mobile robots travel in uncertain environment, traditional methods are based on detailed description of the environment, RL enables agents to learn from interacting with the environment, but this trial and error method is inefficient and unsafe, so it is necessary to propose modifications.

## Projects & Experiences
1. **Decision and planning algorithm for autonomous cars**

My job was to survey existing methods for decision and planning methods for autonomous cars and develop a model to decide whether lane changing is allowed. I used a gap model and a model based on finite state machine.[Planning & Decision-Making Overview](Planning & Decision-Making Overview.png)

2. **Development of fuzzy brain emotional learning (FBEL) neural networks and application on control, classification and adaptive filtering systems**

This is a National Natural Science Foundation Project in my graduate school. I developed modified FBEL networks for robot trajectory tracking and nonlinear systems.

3. **End-to-end robot path planning based on deep reinforcement learning**

I simulated end-to-end robotic path planning on ROS and V-rep using Deep Q-learning Network.
